	abstract = {This program has been imported from the {CPC} Program Library held at Queen's University Belfast (1969-2018) Abstract The classification of short hydrogen bonds depends on several factors including the shape and energy spacing between the nuclear eigenstates of the hydrogen. Here, we describe the {NuSol} program in which three classes of algorithms were implemented to solve the 1D, 2D and 3D time independent nuclear Schrödinger equation. The Schrödinger equation was solved using the finite differences based Numerov’s method which was extended to higher dimensions, the more accurate pseudo-spectral Chebyshev c...
